# Final-Project-2021-2022-Processing
Ariel Vainer

This project was made as a final project for my grade 10 computer science class.
I have made 3 different games, snake, flappy panda (also known as flappy bird), and filler (a game that I used to play in my phone).
This code was written after only knowing the basics of processing.
